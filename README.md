# Message echo

How It Works:
The input() function captures what the user types.

If the input is 'exit' (case-insensitive), the program gracefully exits.

Otherwise, it prints the exact message back with a prefix "Echo:" to simulate a basic reflection of the typed message.

This script is useful as a teaching tool or a base for more advanced chatbot applications. If you need it extended with features like message logging, GUI interface, or network communication, Iâ€™d be happy to assist.

Notes:
The program includes input validation to ensure practical values for height and weight.

It classifies BMI according to widely accepted categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese).

Floating-point input allows for more precise measurements.

If you'd like an imperial units version or a GUI-based interface using tkinter or PyQt, I can certainly adapt it accordingly.
